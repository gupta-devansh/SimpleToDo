# SimpleToDo

**Why this exists:**  

I wanted a **super simple ToDo app** â€” no subscriptions, no calendars, no reminders, no "do this, do that" clutter. Just the basics: create lists, add tasks, reorder them by priority, and delete them. Thatâ€™s it. (**As of now!**)  

Most apps overcomplicate things. I donâ€™t even need reminders â€” thereâ€™s **no point in setting up reminders** when youâ€™re just going to snooze or dismiss them anyway. Simply **writing down what you need to do** is enough.  

Couldnâ€™t find an app that matched this simplicityâ€¦ so I vibecoded one. ðŸŽ‰
